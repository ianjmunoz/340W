This repository contains a one game sample of optical player tracking data courtesy of STATS LLC from the 2012-2013 NBA regular season (formatted according to the methods described in our paper and combined with additional covariates gathered by the NBA) and code to perform an simplified analysis of the  methods introduced in [Transition Tensor Markov Decision Processes: Analyzing Shot Policies in Professional Basketball](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05170).
